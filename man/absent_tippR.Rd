\item{absent_list}{Vector of taxa in the total dataset that are not on the tree}

\item{echo_subtrees}{Boolean; Print newick subtree with missing taxa added to screen. Default FALSE.}

\item{echo_revbayes}{Boolean; Print clade constraints with missing taxa added to screen, formatted for RevBayes fossilized birth-death analysis. Default FALSE.}

\description{
Add tips not on existing tree to the tree via user input,
if they do not have congeners on the tree. This function will generate a
 tree, with nodes numbered. For each tip to be added, the user will be asked #'  to enter the number of the node they would like the tip to subtend.
